        <h1> The Unbreakable Vow Theory </h1>
        <h3> By Taurian_Thyme & CrimsonWolf2 </h3>
        <br>
        <p>Ok I think everyone knows concept of "guilty unless proven innocent". </p>
        <p>Basically the meaning of this statement is unless you prove you are innocent, you are guilty. </p> 
        <p>My theory is about Unbreakable Vows. </p> 
        <p>How this statement can actually apply to an Unbreakable Vow? </p>
        <p>An Unbreakable Vow is a promise that you cannot break - if you do, you die.</p>
        <p>Think about it: if your vow was that you could not die, then this sentence would be a very simple way to play an unbreakable vow.</p>
        <p>Unless you die you haven't broken it, and when you do, what can the vow do to you? </p>
        <p>Kill a dead soul?</p>
        <p>So what would actually happen if your Unbreakable Vow is that you can't die?</p>
        <p>I really want Rowling to give us an answer to this. </p>
        <p>No lies I thought of this myself.</p>
